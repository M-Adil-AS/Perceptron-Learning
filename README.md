Binary Linear Classifier - AI Supervised Algorithm

Assign a weight to each input dimension. Go through the data points multiple times and adjust the weights value by considering the difference between actual value and estimate value (hypothesis function).
We constantly try to figure out whether we need to shift a weight value in order to better create some weight vector that is more accurately able to try to estimate what the output should be.
